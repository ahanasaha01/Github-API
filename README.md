# Github-API
KOSS Selections Task - **AHANA SAHA**

I created 2 separate files,i.e., 2 CLI each for one of the inputs needed by the user for developing the GITHUB user app.\
The first one has 1 html file named github.html and 1 js file named script.js.\
I have used this project to take an input of the username and then display the\
1.Username\
2.Name\
3.Avatar URL\
4.URL to the github handle\
5.Email\
6.Biodata\
7.Followers following a given user\
8.Users following\
\
In the main html file,\
A.I have first specified the title of the project and then imported bootstraps in my code.\
B.I displayed the text on the top of the CLI "Github Search User App" inside the style command.\
C.I created the search Username text box and using the button feature, created the search button, by clicking on which the user would be able to interact with server and all the info would be displayed.I sourced the script.js file.\
D.Inside this js file, I have first stored the username and then fetched all the info on GITHUB Api of the person having that username using the link of the URL of GITHUB Api and then concatenated the URL with the username.\
E.I accessed all the metadata specified above and displayed all these on the CLI  using some font style features.\
\
The second one has 1 html file named index.html and 1 js file named script3.js.\
I have used this project to take an input of the username and display the all the repositories of the username and display all these information corresponding to each repository\
1.Private / Public repository\
2.Forks Count\
3.Stargazers count\
4.Watchers count\
