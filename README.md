# Github-API
KOSS Selections Task

I have made 1 main HTML file (github.html) and 2 sub-js files (script.js and script2.js), which I have used in the main HTML file.First of all,I need to mention that I have made 2 search buttons , one Search by username and another Search by repository, but the second one is not working, but I have shared my code for your reference and evaluation. In the html file, I have first set the title for the project and also accessed bootstraps inside the head function. Then, I have giben the title on our Command Line Interface-"Github Search User App". Then I made a text box where user would be searching by his /her username to get all the relevant information from his Github handle and sourced it from script.js file.Similarly,I made another text box where user would be searching by his/her prepository name to get all the relevant information and sourced it from script2.js file.Now, in script.js file, I first acquired the username from the search info and concatenated the string and fetched the data from github API using an URL link with the username.Then I accessed the 
1.Username
2.Name
3.Avatar URL
4.URL to the github handle
5.Email
6.Biodata
7.Followers following a given user
8.Users following
and displayed it on the CLI.
In script2.js file, I first imported username from script.js and concatenated a github url with this username and repository name entered by the user in the second search box.Then I accessed the 
1.Nature of repository
2.Forks Count
3.Stargazers Count
4.Watchers Count
5.Topics of the Repository
6.License
but was unable to display it on the CLI.
This was all I could do within the stipulated time frame.
